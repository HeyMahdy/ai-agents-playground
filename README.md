# Multi-Agent AI Playground

A playground for building and experimenting with **multi-agent AI systems** using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **React-based agents**. This repository demonstrates supervisor-agent patterns, tool integration, and workflow orchestration, designed for **Google Colab development** and rapid prototyping.

## Features

- **Supervisor-Agent Architecture**: Central supervisor agent coordinates sub-agents.
- **Tool Integration**: Agents can invoke tools like APIs, databases, or other helper functions.
- **State Management**: Each agent reads and updates a shared state to communicate results.
- **Conditional Workflow**: Dynamic routing of tasks based on agent decisions.
- **React Frontend**: Optional React-based agent interface for real-time interaction.
- **Google Colab Ready**: All code can be run and tested in Colab notebooks.

## Getting Started
